I'm a budding technologist, Linux user, and open-source enthusiast seeking more consistent and challenging work. I'm a dedicated, natural self-learner working to become an indispensable software engineer. I program in Python, C, C++, and Rust. I'm working to become skilled enough in systems programming to contribute in the development of Operating Systems like Linux.

In my spare time I like to learn new programming languages, customize Linux, write scripts, create video games (and play them occasionally), create digital art using programs like Blender and Gimp, build micro-electronics projects, cook, and read science fiction.
